# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Audio Recorder app

This project contains the Task 3 — React Native Audio Recorder.

Features
- Record audio notes using the device microphone

- Play and pause with duration shown
- Rename and delete recordings
- Search recordings by name

How to run
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the app: `npx expo start`
3. Open on a device or simulator (Expo Go or a local build)

Notes
- This app uses `expo-av`, `expo-file-system`, and `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` for recording and persistence.
- For full device testing (microphone + file access) run on a real device or simulator with audio support.
